This is a repository for a class project
There is a pptx and a docx file that can be downloaded and viewed
I will answer the required questions below:

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
->To interpret user needs one can start with system analysis. It can be done by asking for feedback from the old users and covering the modifications in the code. The specific inputs, as well as outputs for the system, should be identified. A user story is a great way for a user to express their needs. It is a tool that is used mostly in Agile development. It can help understand the perspective of the end-user. It also helps in understanding what the user wants and then create a simple description for it.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
->Waterfall methodology is a good program planning methodology for developing programs. Another good agile process is scrum. These approaches and processes offer unique ways to work with testing, planning, and integration, as well as making sure team members are on the same page. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
->A good team member follows the team standards and project styles in the coding and design process. They also use good and effective communication with each other. All aspects of the project development should be considered by a team members. A good team member is also fully accountable for their actions.
